#### Overview:
LIBEASE is a Library Management System designed with two types of users in mind. Random users can register and login to access various features including browsing the home page, exploring categorized books, viewing detailed book information, borrowing books, and returning them. When a random user borrows a book, the quantity decreases, and when they return it, the quantity increases accordingly. On the other hand, admin users have additional privileges. They can log in to access features such as adding new books, managing all books (including updating details and deleting), but they are restricted from borrowing books. This setup ensures efficient management of the library resources while providing a user-friendly experience for both random users and administrators.
